                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>The Birth of TechCon: From Idea to Innovation Hub</h3>
                <p>In 2016, a small group of passionate developers, entrepreneurs, and engineers gathered in a modest co-working space to share ideas about the future of technology. That gathering sparked what would soon become TechCon, a community-driven tech conference with one goal: to bring innovation to the forefront. The first event hosted fewer than 100 attendees, but the energy, curiosity, and shared vision made it clear — TechCon had tapped into something powerful. From hardware showcases to code jams, the early days were scrappy but ambitious.</p>

                <h3>TechCon Expands: From Local Event to Global Platform</h3>
                <p>By 2019, TechCon had evolved into a major event, drawing thousands of attendees from across the country and eventually the globe. The introduction of live-streamed sessions, international speakers, and interactive hands-on labs marked a shift — TechCon was no longer just a meetup; it had become a global stage for launching ideas. The themes expanded to include AI, cybersecurity, green tech, and inclusive design. TechCon began shaping trends rather than just following them.</p>
